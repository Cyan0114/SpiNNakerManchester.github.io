The PushBot is a robotic platform developed by [Technische Universität München](http://www.ei.tum.de/en/research/coc-neuro-engineering/).

# Hardware Overview

## Robot Features

  * 2 tracks, each controlled by 2 wheels.
  * A silicon retina.
  * A laser.
  * A LED.

## Control Systems

The robot can be connected to a SpiNNaker machine through 2 interfaces.
    * It can go through the SpiNNaker link connector via the WiFi connector provided above.
    * It can be connected to SpiNNaker via the access point (shown above) indirectly via a host machine and using the SpiNNaker Software Stack.

# SpiNNaker-Facing API

The API for the robot has changed and is now defined in the following google document:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lJ2t5ISbdJpgHs7oGCI9pG10y2xzKz2hoclRX5WocLM/pub](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lJ2t5ISbdJpgHs7oGCI9pG10y2xzKz2hoclRX5WocLM/pub)

## Wifi Access Point

The robot's wifi interface consists of a WiFi access point to which the pushbot communicates with regardless of the connection type for SpiNNaker. The network details are below. But for simplicity, the password to log into the access point is rpo45trkrfgpoloektr45poael

## Setting your uni machine to communicate with generic 4 chip boards.

### University machines

If you are using a desktop machine and the host configuration, you will need a wifi adaptor, as shown below, to connect to the wifi access point. These can be acquired from central services through the website http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/hardware. The systemw as originally tested with the WiPi adaptor from there.

If you are using a remote profile supported by centeral services, you need to be careful with your configuration to stop your wifi adaptor overwriting your ethernet gateway address. The best option we have found is to plug in a switch between your machine and the ethernet socket, and then wire that to the wifi access point and then do the following commands.

    sudo ip addr add 10.162.177.254/24 dev eth0
    sudo ip addr add 192.168.240.254/16 dev eth0

### Ubuntu machines
1. open a command terminal and enter the following commands.

    sudo ip addr add 192.168.240.254/16 dev eth0
    ifconfig

if this is successful, you should be able to ping the standard 4 chip board that communicates on ip address 192.168.240.253

### Windows machines
1. install (WinIPConfig 4.0)[http://www.pkostov.com/wordpress/?p=19}
2. turn on WinPIConfig and if message about interface on 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 click yes (we currently dont know what that is)
3. right click on window labeled "available IP configurations loaded form: ...." and click add new configuration item.
4. add the following data:
    IP_ADDRESS: 10.162.177.254
    SUBMASK:    255.255.255.0
5. click ok
6. right click on window labeled "available IP configurations loaded form: ...." and click add new configuration item.
7. add the following data:
    IP_ADDRESS: 192.168.240.254
    SUB_MASK:   255.255.0.0
8. click ok
9. click on "detailed interface view" and open up tabs till you reach your ethernet adaptor
10. right click on ethernet adaptor and click on "add secondary ip address ...."
11. select the ip_address 10.162.177.254
12. right click on ethernet adaptor and click on "add secondary ip address ...."
13. select the ip_address 192.168.240.254
14. verify that the ip_addresses exist in your ethernet adaptor (see below)
15. open up a command prompt and once powering up the pushbot and the
spinnaker_link device ping the machines through the below commands:
    ping 10.162.177.56
    ping 10.162.177.57

## connection order for the spinnaker link based protocol to behave

connect the SpiNNaker wifi connector to the 0 SpiNNaker link where the board is hovering over the SpiNNaker chips (as shown below). Be careful to align the pins correctly, otherwise you shall find it wont respond at all

<right>
<img src="connected_zoomed.jpg" style="width: 400px">
</right>

It seems to be a issue that if the components are not connected and powered in a specific order, then communication fails. The successful connection order is below:

1. turn off:
    1. spinnaker board
    2. wifi adaptor power (usb thing)
    3. push bot

2. turn on push bot and wait for it to connect to wifi (flashing green light) and then ping to verify you can communicate with it
3. turn on wifi module (put in usb) wait for flashing green light. ping to verify you can talk to it
4. turn on spinnaker board,
5. run script.
