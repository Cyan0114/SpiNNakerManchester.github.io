The workshop will focus using SpiNNaker in robotics; including but not limited to presentations on:

 - Introduction to SpiNNaker hardware & software
 - Specifying networks in PyNN 0.9
 - Using the HBP portal
 - Simple data I/O and visualisation
 - Connecting external devices to SpiNNaker
 - Adding new neuron & synapse models & learning rules

The workshop consists of sessions of presentations by the software team as well as hands-on labs with SpiNNaker hardware. There will also be time to discuss your own project plans and issues with the design team during the week.

Attendees should have some prior experience with Python. For the topics on new neuron models and learning rules, some background in C is highly recommended.
